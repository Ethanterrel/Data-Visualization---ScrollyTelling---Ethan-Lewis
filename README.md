# Data-Visualization---ScrollyTelling---Ethan-Lewis
Data Visualization Project 1

Scrollytelling is a technique to have a visualization adapt in response to a viewerâ€™s scroll location on a web page. As the viewer scrolls the page, the text and the visualization will change to highlight key points and to tell an interactive story. The goal for Scrollytelling is to provide the viewer with an overarching context, then to dive into key insights and details. A great Scrollytelling experience ends with the main takeaway which synthesizes all the insights into a cohesive final insight.
